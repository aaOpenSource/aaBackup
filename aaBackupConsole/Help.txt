Usage Notes
To specify the value of a command line switch use the form /switch:value.
	Example:
	/GRNodeName:localhost
	
For string values that might have a space always use "" around the value.
	Examples:
	/ObjectList:"aaEncryptionExample,atest,Area_001"
	/BackupFolder:"c:\backups"

Password Encryption:
To avoid having to save passwords in clear text the application allows you to specify a clear text password for the argument PasswordToEncrypt.  The application will encrypt the specified password and show the results in a notepad file.  Copy the text and use that as the argument specified for EncryptedPassword.  This will only work for use on the same computer as the encryption algorithm uses unique identifying information from the local computer to generate encryption keys.
