System Platform Backup

This is an application meant to be run from the command line to perform numerous types of Galaxy Object backups or exports.

For now you need to download the source and compile using your own GRAccess DLL.  Trying to figure out the exact licensing situation so we don't run afoul of the PTB @Invensys

Thanks,
Andy
